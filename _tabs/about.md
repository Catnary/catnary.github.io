### This site
I set up this GitHub pages site to experiment with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator in Ruby.

The site uses Cotes Chung's Chirpy theme and is based on the [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) repo.


### Catnaries
The original catnary was a white cat called Silky who sprouted wings after being painted yellow in [The 13-Storey Treehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_13-Storey_Treehouse). I have a habit of creating account names and passwords based on things I can see at the time, and that book was in my line of sight when I created this GitHub account.
